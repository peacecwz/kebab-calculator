It's a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled on an open `mangal` or grill filled with burning charcoal The culinary item is named after Adana, the fifth largest city of Turkey [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana_kebab%C4%B1).

## Your challenge üçΩ 
 
The most common problem in this festival is calculating how much material is needed to create the longest possible kebab based on the number of people you're expecting to feed. Since there are so many people at the festival, the materials must be calculated quickly.
 
You need to produce a fast serverless solution to this problem. Create a **kebab calculator** that, given a certain amount of meat in kilos, can calculate how many people you'll be able to feed as well as how long your kebab can be!
 
Keep in mind that kebabs aren't only made of meat! Here's a [recipe](https://www.thespruceeats.com/adana-kebab-4164647) that you can work with:

- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin (divided)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground sumac (divided)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

With your fast calculator, you might be able to win the prize!
